# cdigits
Initial code for coding puzzle
This is a version in Python 3, with copious comments that should make it self-documenting.
Here is output from a sample run (which also displays the goal of the program):

>num_puzzle3a.py

0 through 9, such that the first digit is evenly divisable by
1 (trivially true), the number formed by the first two digits
is evenly divisible by 2, the number formed by the first three
digits is evenly divisible by 3, and so on for each of the ten
digits.
